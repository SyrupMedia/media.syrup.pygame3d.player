## About
This is a free and open-source game framework and player controller using the Pygame module for the Python programming language.

This is not intended for professional use; it is really primitive all things considered. This was made in a single sitting in hopes of making
Pygame game development more accesible. 

## Dependencies
This project depends on the Pygame and PyOpenGL modules for Python.

Here is the installation command:
```zsh
pip install pygame pyopengl
```
