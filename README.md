## About
This is a free and open-source game framework and player controller using the [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org) module for the Python programming language.

This is not intended for professional use; it is really primitive all things considered. This was made in a single sitting in hopes of making
Pygame game development more accesible. 

## Building
You can build this project using [Cython](https://cython.org) in order to turn it into a shared library file.

## Dependencies
This project depends on the [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org) and [PyOpenGL](http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/) modules for Python.

Here is the installation command:
```sh
pip install pygame pyopengl
```

If you are looking to build this project using [Cython](https://cython.org), 
you will have to install that as well.

Here is the installation command:
```sh
pip install cython
```
